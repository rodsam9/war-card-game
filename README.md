# Overview

Do you love card games? Well here goes a very old, fun card game you can play! This is based off of luck and requires no skill.
You deal cards against your oppenent(CPU), and if your card is higher than you win the round and get a point. 
The person with the most points at the end wins the game! Go ahead and give it a try!

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I could maybe add where there is only 52 cards in total and in order to win you have to have all 52 and other player 0. So everytime you win, you get a point and the other person loses a point(card).
* I think the design was very basic, but maybe I could add more animations or cool features to the app.
* Maybe add a how to play game, make the game more complex.
